    "        - All of them have an only head\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "   - Define also a couple of methods:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       - `many_teeth` --> number of teeth gives you a clue of how old the dinosaurs are, that's why it could be interesting to be able to change the number of teeth they have.\n",
    "       - `add_skill` --> this method add skills to each dinosaurs instance. \n",
    "       - `is_dangerous` --> not all of the dinosaurs are nice, some of them are a little bit dangerous and could attacks you, with this method you should be able to change the boolean set. Make sure, using `if`, the argument is always a boolean, if not print something like \"Remember you should give a boolean, True or False?\"\n"
